## Quality Standards

To be on the list, restaurants should adhere to these quality standards:

- The restaurant can be found at a permanent location.
- The restaurant conforms to cleanliness and heath safety standards.


## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have a [team of maintainers](MAINTAINERS). Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer before it can get merged. **Note: Please consider becoming a maintainer.**  

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. They will wait 8 days for your interaction, after
that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes restaurants may need to be remove or updated, so if you see issues, feel free to change its listing or let us know.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits restaurants that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!  Looking forward to your contribution.
